# Forest Cover Change Detection and Prediction over Pakistani Areas

The aim of this project is to use Sentinel and Landsat imagery in order to perform forest cover change detection in Pakistan. The first step is to segment an image from our AOI and then do the same for a whole temporal series of images and finally compare them to see what changes occured in forest areas. We also intend to predict forestation change trend in Pakistan.
